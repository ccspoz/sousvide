Notes on Hardware

---
THIS HARDWARE USES MAINS VOLTAGE.

Unqualified persons attempting to build this hardware may be at risk of LETHAL electric shock, starting fires, or otherwise damaging life or property.
If you are not a licensed electrician it may also be illegal to build or use this device in your locale.
It is YOUR responsibility to assess your skill level, qualifications, and local laws before attempting to build this hardware.

If in doubt, remember: Even the most delicious steak is not worth burning down your house or electrocuting a loved one!

Schematics are provided for a simple logic level AC controller.
This circuit allows a microcontroller at 3 or 5v to switch mains voltage.

Proper isolations MUST be present on the circuit board to prevent arcing and flashover of mains voltage to low voltage components.
In the absense of knowledge of local codes, a minimum 5mm creepage distance between all mains voltage and low voltage lines is assumed.

As heating elements will vary, NO ALLOWANCE is made in the schematics for fuses and proper earthing but they are ASSUMED to be present.
If you do not understand how to implement these safety considerations on your own, you should NOT attempt to build this circuit without assistance from a qualified person.
