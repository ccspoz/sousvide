Excel spreadsheet useful for simulating a simple PID Loop and finding gain values.

The sheet assumes active heating of a mass of water, and passive cooling.

Usage:
Enter the parameters on the calc sheet, and then go to the graph sheet to change the gains and see how it affects the settling time and stability.
This tool allows you to simulate the PID gains instantly, and find acceptable gains by trial and error (or goal seek) rather than having to run real-world tests which take a lot of time.

I found the gains found on this sheet provide a very useful starting point for real-world testing, and ended up being very close to the final values I chose.
